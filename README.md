# SESO Code Coding Challenge A21

## Challenge: Log Sorting


You have been a set of **log sources**.  Each log source is contains N log entries.  Each entry is a javascript object with a timestamp and message.  You don't know how many log entries each source has - however - you do know that the entries within each source are sorted chronologically (that last bit is important).

Your mission is to print out all of the entries, across all of the sources, in chronological order.  You don't need to store the final collection of all the entries, simply print them to console.

We expect candidates to spend 1-3 hours on this exercise.

## Pointers & Callouts

* You don't know how long each log source is.  Each source could have millions of entries and be terabytes in size. In other words, reading the entirety of a log source into memory probably wonâ€™t work well.
* Some log sources could contain logs from last year, from yesterday, even from 100 years. You won't know the timeframe of a log source until you start looking.
* Consider what would happen when you're asked to merge 1K log sources, or even 1 million log sources.  Where might your bottlenecks arise?

There are two parts of the challenge which you'll see when you dive into things.  You can get started with things by running `npm start`.

## Submission

Create a GitHub repo and email your point-of-contact the link.

## How do we evaluate your submission?

1. Code cleanliness. ðŸ‘‰ *Does the code demonstrate a commitment legibility and understandability?*
1. Code efficacy. ðŸ‘‰ *Does the code work? Does the code address the questions being asked?*
1. Code efficiency. ðŸ‘‰ *Does the code exhibit an understanding of the problem and **drain the log sources efficiently?***
